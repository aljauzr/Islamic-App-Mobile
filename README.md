# Islamic App

A flutter-based mobile application showing a list of daily prayer fetched from https://islamic-api-zhirrr.vercel.app/api/doaharian and a list of Asma'ul Husna (Names of Allah) fethed from https://islamic-api-zhirrr.vercel.app/api/asmaulhusna. There's also extra features inside the Profile menu: Fitur Tambahan showing currency and time converter, Kesan dan Saran showing my testimony of the subject of this project (because this app is mainly made to fulfill the final task of this subject, Mobile's Technology and Programming).
